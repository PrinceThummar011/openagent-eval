## Project Understanding

**OpenAgent Eval** is an open-source CLI framework for evaluating RAG systems and AI Agents.

**Core Problem:** Developers can build RAG systems but cannot reliably measure quality, compare experiments, detect hallucinations, or identify retrieval failures.

**Solution:** A local-first, developer-friendly evaluation framework that runs entirely from the command line.

**Target:** Become the `pytest` of AI evaluation.

**Production-Grade Vision:** Go beyond pipeline evaluation to validate the entire RAG stack — from corpus health through retrieval quality to generation faithfulness. Be the only tool that can tell you not just "your RAG scored 0.91" but "your RAG scored 0.91, but 23% of your corpus is stale and 3 documents contradict each other."

## Key Research Findings (2026)

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| 70-80% of enterprise RAG deployments never reach stable production | Gabriel Anhaia, April 2026 |
| 90% of production failures are retrieval problems | Zartis, March 2026 |
| 67% of "hallucinations" are actually extractive (wrong corpus data) | Renmin University + Tencent, 2025 |
| 38.4% cite "data that fails to update" as primary failure cause | Sinequa, June 2026 |
| Existing tools measure pipeline quality but never question the corpus | K-AI, June 2026 |

### Milestone 7: Functional Evaluation Pipeline (CORRECTED)
> NOTE: The pipeline (`core/pipeline.py`) was previously a STUB — `_evaluate_item`
> never called a retriever, LLM, or any metric, so `oaeval run` produced empty
> results despite the earlier "complete" status. This was fixed on 2026-07-10.
- [x] `Pipeline._evaluate_item` now runs Retriever → LLM → Metrics end-to-end
- [x] `Engine` wires providers (factory) + metric registry + `Executor`
- [x] `providers/factory.py` maps provider config → adapter instances
- [x] Mock LLM + Mock Retriever for offline dry-run (no API keys)
- [x] `Executor.gather` for bounded parallel item evaluation (D006)
- [x] `recall_at_k` fixed to true recall (was binary, == hit_rate)
- [x] `Pipeline._compute_summary` reports real error count (was hardcoded 0)
- [x] Hallucination metric no longer swallows all errors
- [x] Heavy models (SentenceTransformer/Ragas) cached per metric instance
- [x] Config template + `MetricsConfig` defaults aligned to registry names
- [x] `DatasetItemModel.ground_truth_contexts` added for retrieval eval
- [x] Integration test (mock end-to-end) + recall_at_k unit test added

None currently.

## Architecture Decisions Applied

| ID | Decision | Status |
|----|----------|--------|
| D011 | CLI Naming Convention | ✅ Applied |
| D012 | Core Module Structure | ✅ Applied |
| D013 | Exception Hierarchy | ✅ Applied |
| D014 | Testing Structure | ✅ Applied |
| D015 | Configuration Validation | ✅ Applied |
| D016 | Documentation Workflow | ✅ Applied |

---

## Git Workflow Rules (MANDATORY)

GitHub Flow must be followed throughout the project.

### Rules

- **NEVER** develop directly on the `main` branch
- The `main` branch must always remain stable and production-ready
- For every task:
  1. Create a new Git branch before making any code changes
  2. Perform all work on that branch
  3. Push the branch to the remote repository when complete
  4. Create a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch
  5. **Do NOT merge** - the user will review and merge manually

### Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/{description}      # New features
fix/{description}          # Bug fixes
docs/{description}         # Documentation updates
refactor/{description}     # Code refactoring
test/{description}         # Test additions/updates
chore/{description}        # Maintenance tasks
```

## Notes

- Phase 1 is complete - all foundation work done
- Phase 2 is complete - Data Layer implemented
- Phase 3 is complete - Metrics System implemented (86 tests)
- Phase 4 is complete - Reports System implemented (78 tests)
- Phase 5 is complete - Provider Layer implemented (138 tests)
- Phase 6 is complete - Plugin System implemented (27 tests)
- Phase 7 is complete - Evaluation pipeline is now functional (was a stub)
- Phase 8 is pending - Documentation
- **Phase 9-13 are NEW** — Production-grade RAG evaluation features
- **Phase 13 is COMPLETE** — CI/CD Integration (pytest plugin, threshold gating, `oaeval test` command)
- **Phase 14 is COMPLETE** — TUI removed, CLI-only interface retained
- **Phase 12 is COMPLETE** — Synthetic Test Data generator implemented (56 tests)
- CORRECTION: earlier "517+ passing / all phases complete" status was inaccurate —
  the core pipeline did not actually evaluate. That gap is closed.
- `oaeval run` now produces real answers, computed metrics, token usage, and latency.
- Offline dry-run works via `llm.provider: mock` + `retriever.provider: mock`.
- Ready to proceed with Phase 8 (Documentation), Phase 9 (Corpus Auditor), or Phase 14 (Hybrid CLI UI).

## Competitive Advantage

**What makes OpenAgent Eval unique vs RAGAS, DeepEval, TruLens:**

1. **Corpus Health Auditor** — No existing tool validates the knowledge base itself
2. **Blame Attribution** — No existing tool tells you WHERE the failure occurred
3. **NLI-based Scoring** — Word overlap is insufficient for production use
4. **Synthetic Test Data** — Bootstrap evaluation from your corpus
5. **CLI-first, Local-first** — No cloud services, no dashboards, no authentication
