## Why OpenAgent Eval

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-rocket-launch: **Local-First**
  Runs entirely on your machine. No cloud services, dashboards, or authentication required — your data never leaves your laptop.

- :material-console-line: **CLI + SDK**
  Drive evaluations from the command line with `oaeval`, or import `openagent_eval` directly into your Python test suite.

- :material-puzzle: **Framework Agnostic**
  Works with any RAG implementation — LangChain, LlamaIndex, or fully custom pipelines.

- :material-puzzle-plus: **Plugin-Based**
  Extend the framework with custom metrics, providers, and report generators through a clean plugin API.

- :material-chart-box: **Comprehensive Metrics**
  Retrieval, generation, performance, and cost evaluation in a single, consistent interface.

- :material-file-document-multiple: **Beautiful Reports**
  Terminal, Markdown, HTML, and JSON output formats with built-in failure analysis.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install openagent-eval

# Initialize a configuration file
oaeval init

# Run your first evaluation
oaeval run config.yaml

# Inspect the report
oaeval report latest
```

See the [Quickstart](quickstart.md) for a full walkthrough, or jump straight to the
[CLI Reference](cli.md).

## Architecture Overview

OpenAgent Eval is built as a modular pipeline. A configuration file describes your dataset, retriever,
LLM, and the metrics you want to compute. The engine loads the dataset, runs retrieval and generation,
then scores the results with the selected metrics and produces a report.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Config<br/>config.yaml] --> B[Engine]
    C[Dataset] --> B
    B --> D[Retriever<br/>Provider]
    B --> E[LLM<br/>Provider]
    D --> F[Context]
    E --> G[Answer]
    F --> H[Metrics]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Report<br/>Terminal / MD / HTML / JSON]
```

Every stage is pluggable. Read more on the [Architecture](architecture.md) page.

## Evaluation Metrics

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-magnify: **Retrieval**
  Context Precision, Context Recall, Recall@K, Precision@K, Hit Rate, MRR, NDCG.

- :material-message-text: **Generation**
  Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy, Hallucination, Semantic Similarity, Exact Match / F1, BLEU / ROUGE, BERTScore.

- :material-timer: **Performance**
  Embedding, retrieval, and LLM latency plus total end-to-end latency.

- :material-currency-usd: **Cost**
  Token counting (prompt, completion, total) and per-provider cost estimation.

## Supported Providers

| LLM Providers | Retriever Providers |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama (local) | Chroma (more coming soon) |

Bring your own by implementing the provider base classes — see [API Reference](api.md).

---

## Python SDK

```python
from openagent_eval import Evaluator

evaluator = Evaluator(config_path="config.yaml")
result = evaluator.evaluate(dataset)

print(result.summary)
```

The SDK is fully documented in the [API Reference](api.md) and demonstrated in
[Examples](examples.md).

---

## CLI
