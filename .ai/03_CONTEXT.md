## Project Understanding

**OpenAgent Eval** is an open-source CLI framework for evaluating RAG systems and AI Agents.

**Core Problem:** Developers can build RAG systems but cannot reliably measure quality, compare experiments, detect hallucinations, or identify retrieval failures.

**Solution:** A local-first, developer-friendly evaluation framework that runs entirely from the command line.

**Target:** Become the `pytest` of AI evaluation.

## Architecture Decisions Applied

| ID | Decision | Status |
|----|----------|--------|
| D011 | CLI Naming Convention | ✅ Applied |
| D012 | Core Module Structure | ✅ Applied |
| D013 | Exception Hierarchy | ✅ Applied |
| D014 | Testing Structure | ✅ Applied |
| D015 | Configuration Validation | ✅ Applied |
| D016 | Documentation Workflow | ✅ Applied |

---

## Git Workflow Rules (MANDATORY)

GitHub Flow must be followed throughout the project.

### Rules

- **NEVER** develop directly on the `main` branch
- The `main` branch must always remain stable and production-ready
- For every task:
  1. Create a new Git branch before making any code changes
  2. Perform all work on that branch
  3. Push the branch to the remote repository when complete
  4. Create a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch
  5. **Do NOT merge** - the user will review and merge manually

### Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/{description}      # New features
fix/{description}          # Bug fixes
docs/{description}         # Documentation updates
refactor/{description}     # Code refactoring
test/{description}         # Test additions/updates
chore/{description}        # Maintenance tasks
```

## Notes

- PROJECT.md is comprehensive and well-structured
- Architecture is clear: SDK + CLI dual interface
- Plugin-based design is well-defined
- v1 scope is tightly focused on RAG evaluation
- Future versions (v2: agents, v3: cloud) are clearly separated
- All architecture decisions have been applied to project files
- Project is ready for scaffolding upon approval
