## Decision Log

### D001: No LangChain Dependency

**Date:** 2026-07-08
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Building an evaluation framework that needs to support multiple AI frameworks.

**Decision:** Build as a pure Python framework with adapters, not on top of LangChain or any other AI framework.

**Rationale:**
- Locked into one ecosystem if we build on LangChain
- Frequent breaking changes in AI frameworks
- Hard to support custom RAG implementations
- Extra dependency for everyone

**Consequences:**
- More work upfront to build adapters
- Longer-term maintainability
- Framework agnostic design
- Easier adoption by developers using different frameworks

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Build on LangChain: Rejected due to ecosystem lock-in
- Build on LlamaIndex: Rejected for same reasons
- Build on Haystack: Rejected for same reasons
